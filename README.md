# attendance-scripts
This is a set of scripts that help us as an FRC team facilitiate our attendance
scanning software. By storing all of our data in CSV format, it makes it easy 
for any student to parse through data for statistic analysis, or to see how they
came to the hours that they have.

The goal of our data processes are to:

- Make data processing quick and painless.
- Make data easily accessible in summary format.
- Limit the publicity of private information (student ids).
- Make all tasks repeatable and verifiable.

The scripts provided work together to maintain all of those goals for our attendance scanner.
